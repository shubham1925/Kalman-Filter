### Introduction to Kalman Filters

Kalman filter is a powerful tool for combining information in presence of information uncertainty. It can be used in any place where the information about the system is uncertain. It is used to make an educated guess of what the system will do in the next time-step.

Kalman filter is an ideal tool for systems that are continuously changing. The simple calculations involved means that the speed is an advantage, making it an ideal candidate for real-time systems to be implemented on embedded platform.

### References

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/shubham1925/Kalman-Filter/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shubham1925/Kalman-Filter/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
